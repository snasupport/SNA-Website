                    US Air Force issued an agency-wide requirement to standardize the look and feel of its online courses. The challenge they faced was that most courses had a different design resulting from different course developments done by different vendors. It caused navigation and user issues for Air Force employees while taking the online courses. Through a NJIT DoD grant, S&amp;A Technologies was selected by the USAF to design and build an open source “E-Learning template”, with the objective to provide a course with a standardized user interface and page familiarity. S&amp;A Technologies provided an additional service by designing several types of interactivities and page design choices.
