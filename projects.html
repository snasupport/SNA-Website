                      Accompanying the Coldwell Banker training program was a self-assessment quiz to test a learner’s smart home technology knowledge. What made the assessment
                      unique were the use of remedial video loops.  For example, if a learner submitted an incorrect answer,
                      they were shown the portion of the video that supported the correct answer.

                      Rutgers School of Public Health had a need to improve their training on hazardous materials - Explosive, Radiation, Oxygen Depletion, etc.,
                      and to include field simulations of hazardous incidents. They contracted with Cell Podium to develop a smartphone based HazMat Sensor Training Simulator.
                      The project was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health and Science, NIEHS.  All design, development and programming was done by S&amp;A Technologies.
                      The sensor replicates real-like hazard material readings found in the field using Android, Bluetooth and iBeacon technology.

                      Luuva Music came to S&amp;A Technologies with a unique idea to build a social site for musicians, creating a virtual community for singers,
                      writers, retailers and music related businesses. As with any social site it had to scale, be easy to access, anytime anywhere, engaging and personal.
                      A couple of key features of the site included a musician locator and upcoming gigs and performance venues.
                      S&amp;A was responsible for UX/UI design, overall site design and architecture, plus hosting and programming.

                      US Air Force issued an agency wide requirement to standardize the look and feel of its online courses.
                      The challenge they faced was that most courses had a disparate look to them depending who developed them.
                      This caused navigation and user issues when personnel took US Air Force online courses.  Through a NJIT DoD grant,
                      S&amp;A Technologies was selected by the USAF to design and build an open source “eLearning template,” so no matter what vendor or internal resource were employed for development,
                      the Air Force’s courses would have a standard user interface and page familiarity.  S&amp;A designed in several types of interactivities and page design choices.
                      The template was programed using HTML5.
