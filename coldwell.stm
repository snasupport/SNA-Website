                  <h6>SITUATION</h6>

                  <p style="font-size:15px;">
                      Home automation over the past 2-3 years has become a big selling feature for both the new and existing home market. Smart Home technology is increasingly important to the real estate industry, its presence in homes may result in faster home sales and added value. It is akin to what granite kitchen and bath countertops did for real estate market 12-15 years ago.

                      <br />
                      <br />
                      S&A Technologies’ client, Coldwell Banker, decided to get into the smart home business, convinced that connected properties sell faster and that tech-savvy agents can win more business. Coldwell developed a 2-day classroom training session for their franchise sales agents that covered several topics from the “Evolution of Smart Home technology” to “How to educate prospective home buyers and sellers on the benefits of Smart Home technology.”
                      <br />
                      <br />

                      The feedback for the classroom course was favorable, but course attendance was poor and scheduling was difficult due to the lack of qualified instructors. Hence the need to convert the existing classroom course to an electronic, online, on demand version.
