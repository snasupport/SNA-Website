                  <h6>SITUATION</h6>

                  <p style="font-size:15px;">The owner had the idea to provide automated communication between elderly people in need and their relatives and support. A small staff of 3 people developed the initial product and started to successfully sell it in nursing homes. It turns out that the application and server needed expansion and more robust technologies.</p>
                  <h6>REQUIREMENTS</h6>

                  <p style="font-size:15px;">S&A Technologies was asked to bring the whole components to a more robust and scalable platform and support it for the foreseeable future.</p>

                      <h6>CHALLENGES</h6>
             
                      <p style="font-size:15px;">S&A was confronted with a set of challenges that needed to be overcome. The whole system had to be based on existing and available technologies. A wide variety of expertise was needed (Networking, Android development, Web Server development, subject matter expertise).</p>

                  <h6>ACTIONS</h6>

                  <p style="font-size:15px;">S&A Technologies studied available beacon products and settled on an inexpensive bluetooth beacon. S&A developed a rapid prototype on the web with a graphical interface of a simulated spill site. S&A developed a android app that communications with the beacons and with the database at the same time. Initial field tests were successful from the beginning.</p>
