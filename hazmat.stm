                <h6>SITUATION</h6>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                    Rutgers School of Public Health (RSPH) Office of Public Health Practice (OPHP) asked Cell Podium to collaborate on a project to create virtual sensors for their standard Hazwoper class. Cell Podium applied for an SBIR grant at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The grant got awarded in 2016 with a Phase 1 grant and 2 years later with a phase II grant.

                <h6>REQUIREMENTS</h6>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                    S&A Technologies was tasked to develop a sensor simulator based on Android and iOS. The product should be based on commercially available beacons.
                    The cost for the schools should be kapt low.

                <h6>CHALLENGES</h6>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                    S&A Technologies faced a set of challenges that needed to be overcome: the new system had to be based on already existing and available technologies. A wide variety of expertise was needed, including networking, Android development, Web Server development and subject matter expertise.

                <h6>ACTIONS</h6>
                <p style="font-size:15px;">
                    S&A Technologies surveyed currently available beacon products and settled on an inexpensive Bluetooth beacon. We developed a rapid prototype on the web with a graphical interface of a simulated spill site; we also created an Android app which was able to communicate with beacons and database at the same time. Initial field tests were successful from the beginning on.

                Result: S&A Technologies has successfully delivered sensor application to various schools and applications. In 2019 the US Air Force decided to use the sensor simulator in their training as well and bought the service from Cell Podium.
