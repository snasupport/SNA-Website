                      Coldwell Banker Real Estate, a leading national franchised based real estate company selected S&A Technologies to design and develop an interactive video training program on smart home technology. 
                      S&A was responsible for interactive & instructional design, scripting, talent, motion & animation graphics and editing. Certain video segments of the Coldwell video were shot in S&A’s video production studios.  Here are two videos produced for Coldwell, the first titled “Recognizing Smart Home” is a product introduction video covering smart home products, the second titled “Inside a Smart Home,” is a sales training video on how to sell homeowners on smart home technology.  Both videos were designed to be responsive to play on all digital devices.

                      S&A Technologies is a full service video production, with experience in all production steps; from script to screen. 
                      Its expertise includes the design and production of micro-videos. 
                      Micro-videos are short format videos, focused on a single topic. 
                      Here’s an example of a micro-video, one of a series of training videos produced by S&A Technologies for GAF Building Materials. 
                      Each video focused on a specific roofing problem builders might run into when installing GAF shingles. 
                      This video covers "low-slope” roof installation problems or issues.
