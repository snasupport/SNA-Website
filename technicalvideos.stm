                    Coldwell Banker Real Estate, a leading national franchise based real estate company, selected S&A Technologies to design and develop an interactive video training program on smart home technology. We were responsible for interactive & instructional design, script writing, talent, motion & animation graphics and editing. Certain video segments of this Coldwell Banker video were shot in S&A Technologies’ own video production studios. Here you can watch two videos produced for Coldwell Banker, the first one titled “Recognizing Smart Home” is an introduction video about smart home products; the second video titled “Inside a Smart Home,” is a sales training on how to sell real estates via smart home technology. Both videos have been given a responsive web design for all digital devices.

                    S&A Technologies is a full-service video production company, with long-time experience in all production steps from script to screen. The term “video” reflects both videos of regular length and micro-videos (short formal videos, focused on one single topic). Here you can see an example of a micro-video, one of a series of training videos produced by S&A Technologies for GAF Building Materials. Each video in this series focuses on a specific roofing problem, builders might run into when installing GAF shingles. The present video covers "low-slope” roof installation problems or issues.
